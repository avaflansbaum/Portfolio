                    I fell in love with reading in third grade. The first few major series I read were
                    39 Clues, A Series of Unfortunate Events, and Harry Potter. I mainly read fiction and my favorite 
                    genres are Fantasy, Dystopian, Romance and Thriller. As of 2024 I have read 82 books so here are some 
                    recommendations from the year!
